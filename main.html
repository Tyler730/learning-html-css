<p class="paragraph">Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. <span class="highlight">Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes</span>, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish style are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods <span style="background-color: red">(i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry).</span> Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.[1][2] The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.</p>
